This is the second component of the program: the detection. This Android app reads the Arduino data, and if a significant increase is detected 15 times, then the program proceeds to the third and final component of the program.

Inspired by felHR85's [UsbSerial Library](https://github.com/felHR85/UsbSerial) and hariharan-m's [ArduinoUSB Project](https://github.com/hariharan-m/Arduino-Android-USB)
