# SafeHavenBot
# BPMCalculation
This is the first component of the program: the BPM calculation . This Arduino program calculates an average smoothed BPM and compares it to the user's instantaneous heart rate. If a significant increase in heart rate, specifically a 35% increase, is detected, then the program proceeds to the next component.
